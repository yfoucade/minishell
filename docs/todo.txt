- fix variable expansion
	- if braces, ${EXEMPLE}, check that what is between braces is a name.
	- if ?, $?, replace by exit_status of previous command (thus needs status).
	- if name, $chars, stop at first char that is not a 'name'.
	  name = [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*
	- if, $c, where c is not the start of a name, nor ? or {, then do not interpret $.
	- look for bad or ambiguous redirections.
	- do not interpret single quotes inside double quotes.
$ echo "Hello '$USER'"
Hello '$USER'

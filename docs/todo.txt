2. Do tokenization (for each command in the pipeline)
	- After tokenization, check that each redirection operator
	  is followed by a word.
	- The redirection operators and their associated token (filename)
	  are stored in a separated linked list.
	- All other tokens are in another linked list.
3. Implement variable expansion.
	- if a space or tab or return is found in a variable that is part
	  of a filename -> ambiguous redirect.
4. Pass both lists (redirections and command) to the subshell.

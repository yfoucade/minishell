- improve t_status structure.
	- add arrays args and redirections.
	- add fields for return values of some functions:
		- char	return_value
		- char	*error_message
		the calling function can check whether or not there has been an error,
		and display the error message accordingly.
- fix variable expansion
	- if braces, ${EXEMPLE}, check that what is between braces is a name.
	- if ?, $?, replace by exit_status of previous command (thus needs status).
	- if name, $chars, stop at first char that is not a 'name'.
	  name = [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*
	- if, $c, where c is not the start of a name, then do not interpret $.
	- look for bad or ambiguous redirections.
- Implement redirections.

1. Split input with respect to unquoted newline characters (get linked list).
	each line of the input is considered to be a pipeline.
	successively feed each pipeline to environ->curr_command.
2. Do tokenization (for each command in the pipeline)
	- The redirection operators and their associated token (filename)
	  are stored in a separated linked list.
	- All other tokens are in another linked list.
3. Implement variable expansion.
4. Pass both lists (redirections and command) to the subshell.

[] when killing heredoc child process (sigint), free memory.
[] before executing a command, check if there has been an error during preprocessing.
	- ex: '$ echo ${42}' should not print empty line.
[] In execute_command() (in minishell.c), use macros to interpret
	exit status (man waitpid) after executing command in child process.
[] In parse.c:
	- in parse(), check failure after each update
	- in parse_status(), idem
	- in parse_curr_command(),
		// do not set error messages here. Instead, pass a flag to tell whether
		// to check for ambiguous redirects or not
		// (always look for bad substitution).
		// return value should tell which error happened. values in 'status' should
		// be set within the function expand_array_elements().
